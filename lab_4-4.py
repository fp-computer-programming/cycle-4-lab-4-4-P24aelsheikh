Create a Python file named lab_4-4.py

Use the find method to return the index of the first occurrence of the letter "t" in the word "flibbertigibbet".

Using this value, print the letter immediately following the first "t". hint: you may need to store the index value as a variable!

Create a variable storing you first name written in lowercase. Using a string method, print this variable in uppercase.

Use the split method to split the following sentence at each comma: "I wish, I wish, I was a fish."
